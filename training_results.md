# Training Results Summary

## Data Processing Observations

1. **Missing Images**
- Multiple image files were reported missing from the DeepFashion dataset
- Missing images span across various clothing categories (dresses, tops, pants, etc.)
- This suggests potential data availability or integrity issues that should be addressed

## Training Infrastructure

1. **Hardware**
- Training performed on CPU (as indicated by "Using device: cpu" log)
- Multiple training runs conducted with different configurations:
  - Baseline run (darn_baseline.log)
  - ResNet34 backbone experiments (darn_resnet34_*.log)
  - Various versioned runs (v1.0.0, v1.1.0)

2. **Model Variations**
- Multiple model configurations tested:
  - Baseline DARN architecture
  - ResNet34-based DARN with 512 embedding dimension
  - Different versions suggesting iterative improvements

## Training Runs

1. **Experiment Timeline**
- Multiple training runs from November 30 to December 9, 2024
- Progressive version updates from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0
- Multiple iterations within each version

2. **Model Configurations**
- ResNet34 backbone with 512-dimensional embeddings
- Multiple runs with same configuration suggesting hyperparameter tuning or stability testing

## Recommendations

1. **Data Quality**
- Address missing images in the dataset
- Implement robust data validation pipeline
- Consider dataset cleaning or augmentation

2. **Infrastructure**
- Consider GPU acceleration for faster training
- Implement automated data integrity checks
- Set up systematic experiment tracking

3. **Model Development**
- Continue iterative improvements based on version history
- Document configuration changes between versions
- Maintain systematic evaluation metrics
