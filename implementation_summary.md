# Style Classifier Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a style classification system for fashion images using a dual-branch architecture combining DARN (Dual Attribute-aware Ranking Network) and CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) features.

## Architecture Components

### 1. DARN Model (`src/models/darn.py`)
The DARN architecture is designed for fine-grained attribute prediction with the following key components:

- **Backbone**: Uses VGG16/ResNet34 for feature extraction
- **Dual Branch Structure**:
  - Global Branch: Processes overall image features
  - Local Branch: Focuses on attribute-specific features
- **Attention Mechanism**: Both branches use attribute-aware attention
- **Output**: Produces attribute predictions and feature embeddings for retrieval

Key Features:
- Attribute-specific attention weights
- Dual pathway processing
- Flexible backbone support (VGG16/ResNet34)
- Combined global and local feature representation

### 2. CLIP Encoder (`src/models/clip_encoder.py`)
A wrapper for OpenAI's CLIP model that:
- Extracts visual features from images
- Uses frozen CLIP parameters
- Provides consistent feature representations

### 3. Configuration System (`src/configs/config.py`)
Organized into multiple configuration classes:

- **DataConfig**: Dataset paths and loading parameters
- **ModelConfig**: Architecture and loss function settings
- **TrainingConfig**: Training hyperparameters
